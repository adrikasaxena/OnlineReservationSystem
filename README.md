I developed an **Online Railway Reservation** System using **Java and MySQL**, designed to streamline the process of booking, viewing, and canceling train tickets. The system features secure user authentication, ensuring that only registered users can manage their reservations. It allows passengers to book tickets by specifying details such as **train number, class type, and journey date** while also providing an option to review and cancel bookings if needed. The backend is implemented using **JDBC for database connectivity**, ensuring efficient data handling and seamless interaction with the system. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in **Java programming, SQL database management, and backend development**, while also improving my problem-solving and logical thinking abilities.
